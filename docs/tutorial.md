# Introduction and tutorial

This page aims to give an introduction to how the library works and how to use it to perform some common tasks,
including working code samples.
Detailed information about the library can be found in the rest of the documentation.

All code samples are released to the public domain, just like the rest of the repository.

Note: all code samples use C, not C++, unless otherwise noted.

## 1. Loading an image

Most of the functionality of the library is provided by two functions, [`plum_load_image`][load] and
[`plum_store_image`][store].
These two functions allow, respectively, loading image file data and writing it out.

In the program, image data is represented by a [`plum_image`][image] struct.
This struct contains the image's pixel data, as well as some ancillary information like its dimensions; its full
contents can be found in the corresponding reference page.
(Note: all function, type, constant and macro names link to their corresponding reference pages; click on them for
a full description of them.)

The library's main design concept is to provide a unified interface for all image data.
Therefore, a [`plum_image`][image] struct will contain image data for any format; when an image is loaded, the format
it used will be written to its `type` member, and that same member will determine which format will be generated when
the image data is written out.

The first part of this tutorial will focus on loading and storing images to files.
Loading an image from a file and checking some of its attributes is very simple:

``` c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "libplum.h"

int main (int argc, char ** argv) {
  if (argc != 2) {
    fprintf(stderr, "usage: %s <image>\n", *argv);
    return 2;
  }
  unsigned error;
  struct plum_image * image = plum_load_image(argv[1], PLUM_FILENAME,
                                              PLUM_COLOR_32, &error);
  if (image) {
    const char * format = plum_get_file_format_name(image -> type);
    printf("%s: %s image, %lu x %lu px", argv[1], format,
                                         (unsigned long) image -> width,
                                         (unsigned long) image -> height);
    if (image -> frames > 1)
      printf(", %lu frames", (unsigned long) image -> frames);
    putchar('\n');
    plum_destroy_image(image);
  } else
    printf("%s: load error (%s)\n", argv[1], plum_get_error_text(error));
  return !image; // 0 if it was valid, 1 if not
}
```

A few things can be noted in this example:

- When the program is done using an image, it can release all its resources with [`plum_destroy_image`][destroy].
  This will free everything allocated by the library for that image â€” including, in this case, the image struct
  itself.
- When loading an image, the program must specify the color format it will use.
  The library supports four different [color formats][color-formats], as well as a fifth pixel format for images using
  palettes (referred to as [indexed-color mode][indexed] in this documentation).
  (For images using palettes, the color format indicates the format of the palette data, not the pixel data.)
  The user must request which color format they want to operate with; the library will load the image and convert to
  the chosen color format, regardless of the actual representation used internally by the image file.
  The format chosen in this example, [`PLUM_COLOR_32`][loading-flags], uses 32-bit (`uint32_t`) color values, encoded
  as RGBA 8.8.8.8 (with the red channel in the least significant bits), and with the alpha channel inverted (i.e., 0
  means opaque) for convenience when dealing with images without transparency.
- Some functions can return an error constant describing why they failed.
  The [`plum_load_image`][load] function does so via a return argument (which may be `NULL` if the caller doesn't care
  about the reason for failure).
  Error constants are always positive, and no error (i.e., [`PLUM_OK`][errors]) is zero, so it is possible to test
  whether an error occurred by testing this value.
- At no point does the user tell the library the type of file being loaded.
  Image formats are autodetected: all supported types have distinguishable headers, and thus the library can
  automatically determine which format is being loaded.
  Therefore, any user of the library will automatically be able to handle all supported image file formats out of the
  box.
- Images can have more than one frame.
  This is necessary for formats that contain animations (such as GIF), but also valid in some non-animated formats
  (such as the PNM family of formats).
  If an image contains more than one frame, all frames will have the same dimensions.
